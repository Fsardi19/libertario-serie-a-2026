## Notas de Analisis

### Punto Clave: Definicion de Valuation Cap

La definicion textual es:
> "Valuation Cap: USD 40,000,000 (pre-money) + USD 5,000,000 (finance round)"

**Interpretacion mas probable:**
- El cap es $40M pre-money
- "$5,000,000 (finance round)" indica el tamano de la ronda, no se suma al cap para conversion
- Esto es consistente con la practica estandar de notas convertibles

### Clausula Relevante para Extension (Seccion B del Whereas)

> "This Agreement is one of a series of convertible loan agreements entered or to be entered into by the Company with Investors with similar terms and in the same form as set forth herein, **except mainly for the economic terms and the date of issuance which may differ**."

**Implicacion:** El acuerdo contempla que pueden emitirse notas adicionales con terminos economicos diferentes.
