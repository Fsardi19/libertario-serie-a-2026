**Re: Notice of Extension of Finance Round from USD 5,000,000 to USD 5,500,000**

---

Dear Investors,

Reference is made to the Convertible Loan Agreements (the "**CLAs**") entered into between the Company and each of you during 2025-2026, pursuant to which you have provided convertible loans to the Company on substantially similar terms.

### 1. PURPOSE OF THIS LETTER

The Company hereby provides notice that, pursuant to Recital (B) of the CLAs, which expressly contemplates that:

> *"This Agreement is one of a series of convertible loan agreements entered or to be entered into by the Company with Investors with similar terms and in the same form as set forth herein, except mainly for the economic terms and the date of issuance which may differ."*

The Company intends to issue additional Convertible Loan Agreements to new investors for an aggregate amount of up to **USD 500,000** (five hundred thousand US dollars), thereby increasing the total Finance Round from USD 5,000,000 to USD 5,500,000.

### 2. TERMS OF ADDITIONAL NOTES

The additional CLAs will be issued on substantially the same terms as your existing CLAs:

| Term | Value |
|------|-------|
| Valuation Cap | USD 40,000,000 (pre-money) |
| Discount | 20% |
| Interest Rate | 6% per annum |
| Maturity | 2 years from issuance |
| Qualified Financing Threshold | USD 5,000,000 |

### 3. EFFECT ON EXISTING INVESTORS

The issuance of additional CLAs under the same Valuation Cap will result in a proportional adjustment to the conversion mechanics for all CLA holders, including existing investors.

**Illustrative Impact:**

| Your Investment | Conversion % (at $5M round) | Conversion % (at $5.5M round) | Difference |
|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------------|------------|
| USD 100,000 | 0.270% | 0.267% | -0.003pp |
| USD 250,000 | 0.676% | 0.667% | -0.009pp |
| USD 500,000 | 1.351% | 1.333% | -0.018pp |

This represents an approximate **1.3% relative dilution** from your original position.

### 4. RATIONALE FOR EXTENSION

The Company has determined that the additional capital is necessary and beneficial for the following reasons:

- [COMPLETE: Specific expansion opportunities]
- [COMPLETE: Accelerated store openings]
- [COMPLETE: Working capital optimization]

The additional funding strengthens the Company's position for the anticipated Series A financing and enhances value for all stakeholders.

### 5. NO ACTION REQUIRED

**This letter is for informational purposes only.** No action or consent is required from you. The terms of your existing CLA remain unchanged and fully enforceable.

The Company is providing this notice as a matter of transparency and good governance, consistent with its commitment to maintaining open communication with its investors.
